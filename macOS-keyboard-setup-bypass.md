## macOS Keyboard Setup Bypass

Many modern Mac systems have a security feature that allows them to detect when an unrecognized device is connected and alert the user. For example, when connecting to a new external keyboard, a popup window appears prompting the user to 'set up your new keyboard'. While this is a useful feature for security, it is a roadblock for the purposes of this project. 

### How do Mac computers know when a device is unrecognized? 

Every Mac stores a list of all known Human Interface Device (HID) codes. These include any Apple devices such as keyboards, mice, and speakers, as well as any other trusted devices that have connected to the computer. When a new device connects to the computer, its HID is checked against the list of known codes. If it is present, then the computer will assume it is safe and can be trusted. However, if not, then the computer will alert the user that a new device has connected and prompt further action. 

### How can we work around this? 

In order to ensure a Mac will automatically trust a given device it must have a trusted code. Since all compatible Apple-branded HIDs are present on 'the list', it is as simple as spoofing the HID code to appear as an Apple device. How precisely to do this depends on the hardware and firmware of the specific device you are trying to use.
